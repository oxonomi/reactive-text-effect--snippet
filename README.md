How it works:
Hovering over text element causes the letters in the word to quickly change to random letters every 20ms
it cycles through each letter one at a time from left to right, until returning to default.
if the code has run 1 time, the 1st letter will default, if it's on the 5th iteration the 5th letter will return default etc
code stops running when it gets to the last letter and word is back to default
